This error occurs when using Expo CLI with a project that has an unusual or unexpected file structure, or when there are inconsistencies between the project's configuration files (like `app.json` or `package.json`) and its actual contents.  This might involve using a feature that isn't fully supported or isn't compatible with the current version of Expo CLI.  For example, using a non-standard file extension for a source file, or having a deeply nested directory structure that causes unexpected behavior.  The error messages can often be cryptic, making diagnosis challenging.
