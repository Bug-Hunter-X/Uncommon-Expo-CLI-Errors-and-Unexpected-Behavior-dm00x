To troubleshoot, meticulously check the project structure for any irregularities. Ensure that all file extensions match the expected types (e.g., `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, `.tsx`). Examine your `package.json` and `app.json` files to ensure that the configurations are aligned with your project's file structure and dependencies.  Consider simplifying the project's directory structure to a more standard setup as a diagnostic step. Update Expo CLI and related packages to their latest versions. If you use any custom configurations or third-party libraries, try to isolate their impact to determine if they are contributing to the problem.  Experiment by creating a new, minimal Expo project and gradually incorporating elements from your problematic project to identify the source of the conflict.
